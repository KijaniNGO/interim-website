# Kijani Website



## Development

CSS is written in [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/). For compilation and minifying [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is set up as a task runner.

To develop locally simply `npm install` the required packages and run `npm start` to autocompile source files and serve with live reloading on `localhost:8000`.

To deploy the site on GitHub Pages, simply run `npm run deploy`. The site will be live at https://kijaningo.github.io/interim-website/.
