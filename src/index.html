Our Mission
Our mission is to restore degraded landscapes in Kenya in partnership with local communities

Our Vision
Our vision is to become the leading driver of community-led landscape restoration in Africa

Our Strategy
Kijani provides training in conservation agroforestry, alternative household energy and non-timber forest product utilization to enable rural farmers to improve their livelihoods, health and environment. Kijani also runs multi-year trials to test innovative, low-cost solutions to tree establishment. We want our work to inspire you to see that change is achievable.

Plant – We research and test linkages between indigenous trees, agriculture, pastoralism and soil health and provide trainees with access to tree seedlings for livelihood improvement. We are also running pioneering trials to drive down the cost of tree establishment in Kenya.

Partner – We work with organizations that share our vision for landscape restoration in Kenya through tree establishment and can help us to reach more farmers. These include tree-planting networks, the scientific community and community-based organizations.

Empower –Tree planting and livelihood establishment must co-exist for sustainable landscape restoration to occur. We are establishing demonstration plots in central, western and eastern Kenya to enable communities to see and receive training on our methods first-hand.
